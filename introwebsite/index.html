	<h2>Cole</h2>
	<p>Good to meet everyone! My name is Cole Harris I am from Mountain View Wyoming. The wonderful state where it's always too windy and too cold in the winter and 
		too hot in summer. I'm no where to close to Star Valley or Cheyenne either.</p>
	<p>I have been a member of The Church for 26 years</p>
	<p>I am a software engineering major have been here for 3 or 4 semesters. My hobbies include most of anything outside doing something physical or that is challenging.
		I also really enjoy coding playing games like Doom, Quake, Minecraft, Mario Kart or anything that provides me with a good challenge. I also really enjoy reading and am trying to learn some Unity in my freetime.
		I also love to solve any sort of Rubiks cube and if I don't know how to solve one then I usually will teach myself how to.</p>
